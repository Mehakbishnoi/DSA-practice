# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice problems solved in **C++**.  
Problems are organized by topic for easy navigation.

---

## Folder Structure
- `Array/` - Array problems
- `LinkedList/` - Linked List problems (coming soon)
- `Stack/` - Stack problems 
- `Queue/` - Queue problems (coming soon)

## Array Problems Solved

| Problem | Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---------|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Second Largest Element | Single traversal | O(n) | O(1) |
| Two Sum | traversal | O(n^2) | O(1) |
| Reverse Array | Two-pointer method | O(n) | O(1) |
| Rotate Array Left by d Positions | Temporary array (O(n*d) commented) | O(n) | O(n) |

> Each file contains **well-commented C++ code**, explaining the approach, complexity, and optional inefficient solutions.


## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/<Mehakbishnoi>/DSA-Practice.git

2. Navigate to a folder:
cd DSA-Practice/Array

3. Compile and run a file:
g++ second_largest.cpp -o second_largest
./second_largest


## Contribution

1. I solve one problem at a time and add it to the respective folder (Array, LinkedList, Stack, Queue).

2. Each code file should include:

  Problem description

  Approach or logic used

  Time and space complexity

3. Keep the folder structure organized.

4. If you want to contribute, you can fork the repository, add your problem in the correct folder, and create a pull request.

5. Make sure your code is well-commented and easy to understand.
